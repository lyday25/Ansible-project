# Ansible-project
This is a project that showcases the power of Ansible used for configuration management, deployment and IT automations in a distributed system, using the push configuration model of Ansible controller that has the power of pushing ad-hoc commands into remote servers or target machines.

# ANSIBLE FOR CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

Ansible uses configuration management

Ansible uses uses password;less connection

Push configuration model

Ansible is agentless

Ansible uses yaml file that is already used to by most engineers t9o write ansible playbooks

Ansible works with  most of the cloud providers but what matter to ansible is that does the machine has public ip address , is ssh connection enabled allowed from ansible to the remote machines

##
Ansible should be able to communicate to the other servers through passwordless authentication.. That's the only recognition

If ansible can do that it can do anything


# always talk to the private ip address of the target machines
